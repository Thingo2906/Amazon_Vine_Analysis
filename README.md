# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview:
- The goal of this study was to determine if Amazon's Vine program reviews are accurate by assessing whether there is a bias factor between Vine memeber reviews and non-Vine memeber reviews.
- I chose the Furniture category to study out of the 50 datasets available.
## Results:

From the data set we see following:
- The ratio of Vine members : Non-Vine members is close to 1:132 (136:18002),
- The same ratio is applied to 5 star reviews that were given by both (74:8472),
- The percentage of each group giving 5 star reviews is 54% Vine members and 47% Non-Vine members.

## Summary:
- Based on a comparable percentage of users (Vine: Non-Vine) and five-star ratings from those users. If there is a significant disparity between the proportion of 5 star ratings and the overall number of reviews, this might indicate that the reviews are biased. The question is whether there is a bias in favoring or disfavoring certain people, and if so, why. However, the data appears to be neutral for both groups, with 54 percent of Vine memebers and 47 percent of non-Vine memebers.
